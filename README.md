# 🎬 Netflix-Style Portfolio

A personal portfolio inspired by the Netflix UI, built to showcase projects in a fun and cinematic way.

## 🚀 Inspiration
I came across an Instagram reel featuring a Netflix-like portfolio and wanted to create my own unique version. This hackathon gave me the push to finally make it real.

## 🛠️ How It Was Built
- Started with HTML & CSS for the base design  
- Improved responsiveness and styling with the help of AI tools  
- Iterated until it felt polished and personal  

## 🏆 Accomplishments
- Responsive web design  
- A portfolio that blends creativity with functionality  

## 🔮 What's Next
- Add more projects to the site  
- Integrate movie-poster style visuals  
- Expand into a full "cinematic portfolio experience"
